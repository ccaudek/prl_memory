# Project Overview

Inspired by the work of Frank and colleagues (Jang, A. I., Nassar, M. R., Dillon, D. G., & Frank, M. J., 2019), which demonstrated that Reward Prediction Errors (RPEs) predict memory accuracy, this project investigates how *surprise*, induced by an external event unrelated to participants' behavior, affects memory. Instead of RPEs arising from participants' choices, the surprise is triggered by videos interspersed within trials of a Probabilistic Reversal Learning (PRL) task. In a control condition, non-surprising videos are used.

## Method

### PRL Task

Participants engage in the following sequence:

**Sequence:** Video → 5 PRL trials → Video → 5 PRL trials → ...  
**Duration:** Each session lasts approximately 5-10 minutes.

The PRL task presents two pictures in each trial: either the participant’s own picture or that of a stranger, with a different colored-background. In each picture and in each trial, the person depicted holds a different object.

- **Task Objective:** Maximize positive feedback during the PRL task.  
- **Instructions:** Participants are informed that, at the end of the experiment, they will be asked questions about the videos and about the objects shown in the trials.

At the end of the experiment, participants will be asked to rate the amount of surprise elicited by the videos. Also to report whether they found the video surprising throughout the whole experiment or not. 

TODO Devise some other question and determine how to record the participants' responses.

### Memory Task

Immediately following each session, participants complete a recognition test where they see two pictures side by side: one that was shown during the previous PRL session (Old) and a new picture (New). They are instructed to identify the picture they recall seeing.

## Design

Participants complete 4 sessions, each incorporating the following conditions in a randomized order:

- Self vs. Stranger (2 levels)  
- Surprise vs. No-Surprise (2 levels)

This results in a 2x2 design, with session order randomized for each participant.
